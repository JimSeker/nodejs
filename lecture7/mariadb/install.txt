install mariadb 
  start it.  make sure you set the root password 

  on pi's  for root:  sudo mysql -u root -p
     sudo apt install mariadb-server
     sudo mysql_secure_installation
  otherwise sudo mysql -u user -p    
    then enter the pasword for the user account

Note: 
you can change the username from mobileapp to something else
the database name is named: cosc4735  (change it as you see fit)
and don't use password as the password.   

create database cosc4735;
grant all privileges on cosc4735.* to 'mobileapp'@localhost identified by 'password' with grant option;

notes:
SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%' = PASSWORD('newpass');  //also global access
If you want to delete a password for a user, you would do:
SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@localhost = PASSWORD("");  //delete a local password.


exit mysql, we don't need root anymore

mysql -u mobileapp -p

connect cosc4735
create table if not exists highscore ( name varchar(100) not null unique, score INT not null);

cmd:
 npm init -y
 npm install express
 npm install mariadb
 npm install body-parse
 npm install express-handlebars
 npm install dotenv
